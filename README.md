# WIKIPEDIA BIG DATA ANALYSIS

* This project analysis consists of using big data tools to answer questions about datasets from Wikipedia.

* There are a series of analysis questions, answered using Hive and MapReduce. The tools used are determined based on the context for each question.

* The output of the analysis includes MapReduce jar-files and .hql files so that the analysis is a repeatable process that works on a larger dataset.
